      challenge however you are most comfortable.

      The files you will need to edit are in <code>/src/answers</code>. Make the
      changes required for each challenge. When you are done, delete{" "}
      <code>node_modules</code>, zip up the folder, and email this zip file back
      to us. Please remember to delete <code>node_modules</code> because it will
      make your zip much smaller.
